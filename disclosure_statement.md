# Disclosure Statement

(last update: 2016-12-02)

This blog is a personal website written and edited by me, Oliver Jaun. It contains blog posts of all kinds but mainly about computer science and music. The aim is to provide the reader with some hopefully interesting post, mostly based on my personal experiece.

I express my personal opinions and views and may be biased. I am not a professional writer or journalist. So do not expect the posts to meet any journalistic standards. Keep in mind that I am writing this blog in may spare time. Also note that english is not my mother thong. This may lead to misunderstandings which are not intended. Feel free to send me corrections.

I use Google AdSense on some pages, which is keyword-based and reacts automatically to the content which is presented on the site. I have no say over the ads that appear and like the ad network mentioned above, for editorial reasons, I like to keep a hands-off policy with those ads.

The blog contains a commenting function. I may delete any of these comments without further notice and without any explanation.
